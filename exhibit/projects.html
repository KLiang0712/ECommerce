          Word Cloud #1 is developed with research-based web development and
          chart CDN scripts to analyze backend text.
          <br />It is created with basic HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and chart
          frameworks<br />
          for saving text in the backend for analysis that will be used for a
          cloud display.
          <br />Embedded in the web development process are JavaScript chart CDN
          scripts using amCharts4 and d3.js. <br />Based on the backend text
          analyzed, the tags in the cloud reveal my career interests and what I
          have learned throughout my studies.<br />

          Word Cloud #2 is developed using manual tags in various sizes using
          basic frontend development with HTML5 and CSS3.<br />
          This word cloud is basically developed only with frontend web
          development with assigned font sizes based on weight and colors of my
          own choice.
          <br />The tags are planned by the developer with larger sizes being
          the most important and smaller sizes indicating significance as a
          work-in-progress.<br />
          My sample project shows various programming langauges as tags with the
          larger size being more knowledgeable and<br />the smaller sized tags
          as the subjects for self-study or in progress of learning.

          Word Cloud #3 is developed using Highcharts CDN and JavaScript to list
          out data from backend to be used for display.<br />
          The data stored in the backend is our own choice of single or pair of
          words which represent the tags used to form the cloud.<br />
          The cloud I designed represents all the skills and chart frameworks I
          used to develop all the cloud projects listed.<br />
          The design of this cloud is designated to list out all chart CDNs used
          in addition to the programming languages used to create word clouds.

          out our own choice of words to be used as tags that will help develop
          the cloud.<br />The tags for this cloud will reveal all the skills,
          languages, and frameworks I used to develop my Computer Science
          major.<br />
          ECharts has many versions and is used to create word clouds and other
          various data visualizations.<br />
          Currently, I am pairing AJAX with ECharts Version 2 from Amazon Web
          Services S3 (Wagner, J, 2016).
