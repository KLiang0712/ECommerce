        Word Clouds are visual displays done in graphics of text data
        presentations shown in various sizes and colors.
        <br />Each word has a different size that has a ratio with its frequency
        or significance in the text. The larger sized words are the most
        common and frequently used. Otherwise, words not used very often are shown in smaller font sizes.<br />
        Word Clouds help provide a clear and efficient visualization of the
        important keywords, topics, and main ideas within the text.
        <br />We use Word Clouds for text mining, data analysis, and other
        visual communication or summarizing of text data that is engaging
        (Amcharts).

        Word Clouds are known as Tag Clouds or Weighted List Charts and are a
        tool used in Data Visualization for representing data in the form of
        text.<br />
        They perform analyses for counting words across tags, keywords, and
        other types of context.<br />
        Word Clouds are created to provide the importance of each tag or keyword
        being searched for.<br />
        The levels of importance for each tag are represented through various
        sizes as a basic and most often using different colors.<br />
        Such representation is what defines Relative Prominence.<br />
        The overall purpose of Word Clouds would be to determine any data trends
        or behavior based on quality. Basically, Word Clouds are used for
        Business Intelligence purposes such as relevant qualities analyzed in
        the data to help improve based on User Insights (Think Design, n. d.). A
        Word Cloud is known as various other names including Tag Cloud and other
        names that work include wordle and Weighted List. Word Clouds are visual
        displays done in graphics of text data presentations shown in various
        sizes and colors. Each word has a different size that has a ratio with
        its frequency or significance in the text.<br />
        The larger sized words are the most common and frequently used.<br />
        Otherwise, words not used very often are shown in smaller font sizes.<br />
        Word Clouds help provide a clear and efficient visualization of the
        important keywords, topics, and main ideas within the text. We use Word
        Clouds for text mining, data analysis, and other visual communication or
        summarizing of text data that is engaging (Amcharts).

        Word Clouds are beneficial for analyzing large text documents so they
        are organized based on categories of either being well-known or greater
        in quantity.<br />
        Word Clouds will possess a better visual display of the analysis given
        the challenges of understanding an analysis in the form of a table.<br />
        In general Word Clouds are used for analyzing data for certain trends
        and valuable insight.<br />
        The analyses for these important finds and others are performed in
        detail.<br />
        We could apply the analyses by describing in detail using large-scale
        contexts such as Search Engine Optimization and use as Website
        Navigation Aids. Use Word Clouds as Navigation Aids by creating
        hyperlinks for the terms relevant with the keyword. They will help
        maintain the connection of the website.<br />
        Web crawling of a Search Engine Spider helps improve the Search Engine
        Rank of a website.<br />
        They are also very well known for Search Engine Optimization of
        websites.<br />
        Efficient user navigation of content in an Information System is another
        similar context Word Clouds are well known for.<br />
        Viewing from a User Interface (UI), Word Clouds are frequently used for
        search result summaries for user support.<br />
        Content in a specific Information System is found more efficiently
        (Think Design, n. d.).
